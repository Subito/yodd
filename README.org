* Status
This project is in early development stages, but it does work for me.
Setup is a bit complicated though.
* Requirements
- [[http://mydns-ng.com][mydns]] v1.2.8.31
- [[http://djangoproject.com][Django]] v1.4
(others might work, but are currently untestet)

Additionally, you need to own a domain or subdomain which NS-entry
points to the server which will run yodd.
* Installation
(Installation will be automated in the future)
- setup Django
- clone yodd
- do a syncdb
- setup mydns
- do mydns --create-tables and note the field-types of "data" and some others
- compare the data-types of the rows with the tables django created and alter them if
  neccessary (yodd will continue to work)
* First use
- go to ~yourhost.com/admin/~ and login
- add a StartOfAuthority (not self-explanatory, will automate this
  step in the future with a simpler interface)
- add a host and copy the key (which gets created for you)
- copy the content of update.curl and fill in your hostname and key
- change the URL at the end to ~yourhost.com/update/~
- maybe create a cronjob, which does the curl periodically
- test your new DNS-entry with ~dig~ or ~nslookup~
